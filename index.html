            Front-end development is the process of building components that
            interact with users. Examples are the user interface, buttons,
            user-entered data, websites, and user experience (UX) features. The
            front end aims at meeting user requirements and delivering a
            positive user experience.

            Back-end development means working on server-side software, which
            focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end
            developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on
            databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs),
            architecture, and servers.

          <p>
            Full-stack development is the process of developing both the
            frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend
            (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic)
            component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related
            to user interactions with the application.
